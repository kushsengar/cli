    <h2>How to Pass an Array to a Function in Java?</h2>
    <br><hr>
    <p>Passing an array to a function is an easy-to-understand task in java. Let function GFG() be called from another
        function
        GFGNews(). Here, GFGNews is called the “Caller Function” and GFG is called the “Called Function OR Callee Function”.
        The
        arguments/parameters which GFGNews passes to GFG are called “Actual Parameters” and the parameters in GFG are called
        “Formal Parameters”. The array to pass can be a one-dimensional(1D) array or a multi-dimensional array such as a 2D
        or
        3D array. The Syntax to Pass an Array as a Parameter is as follows:</p>
        <br><hr>
        <h3>Caller Function:</h3>
        <p>returnType: the return type of the called function
            functionName: name of the called function
            datatype: the datatype of the array
            arrayName: name of the array</p> -->
